"Contenerising a application in docker"
  here we are taking a todo app (github repo:https://github.com/Bishnupriya548/learn_docker)
  In this app as we have used node.js so we are contenerising a node js app using docker
1.creating a file called DockerFile
  content of the file:(We have to write it according to our application type)
FROM node:21-alpine   #to specify the base image for the Docker container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app     #setting the working directory
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./     #to copy package.json and package-lock.json files from the local machine into the working directory inside the container
RUN npm install  #to install dependencies
COPY . .    #to copy rest of the application
EXPOSE 3000   #port where the application will run
CMD ["npm" , "start"]   #the command to run when the container starts


  2.docker build -t learn_docker .  #creates a Docker image named learn_docker using the Dockerfile in the current directory which packages the application and its dependencies into an image

  3.docker ps    #ists all the currently running Docker containers

   docker images   #lists all the Docker images stored on the local system
4.docker run -it -d -p 3000:3000 learn_docker  (learn_docker is application name we are using)
  # It will map port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on the host machine, allowing us to access the application.
