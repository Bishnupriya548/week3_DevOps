  here we are taking a todo app (github repo:https://github.com/Bishnupriya548/learn_docker)
  In this app as we have used node.js so we are contenerising a node js app using docker
1.creating a file called DockerFile
  content of the file:(We have to write it according to our application type)

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm" , "start"]


  2.docker build -t learn_docker .

  3.docker ps

   docker images
4.docker run -it -d -p 3000:3000 learn_docker  (learn_docker is application name we are using)
